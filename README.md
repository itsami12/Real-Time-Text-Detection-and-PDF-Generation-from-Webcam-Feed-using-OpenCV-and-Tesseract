# Real-Time-Text-Detection-and-PDF-Generation-from-Webcam-Feed-using-OpenCV-and-Tesseract
This Python script captures real-time video from the default webcam, detects text within each frame using Tesseract OCR, and saves the detected text to a PDF file. The script leverages OpenCV for video capture and processing, and the ReportLab library to create and manage the PDF output.
